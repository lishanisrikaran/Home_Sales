# Home_Sales

A home sales dataset is utilised, this dataset contains information such as the properties': built year, sold date, price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, and if it has a waterfront. Further features such as its square foot and the number of views the property has had are also included within the dataset.

SparkSQL is used to determine key metrics about this home sales data. However, when working with big data, further considerations are needed to ensure that the queries are optimised. Therefore, in this challenge Spark is used to explore potential optimisation tweaks such as:
- Querying data from temporary views
- Loading temporary views into cache
- Storing the data in parquet format
- Determining how the data is partitioned

The Home_Sales file in this repository was created within Google Collaboratory and therefore, it is suggested it is uploaded and ran on this same platform.
